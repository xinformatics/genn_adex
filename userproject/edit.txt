Even afer updating the CUDA version, sometimes the old verison is not replaced from the PATH. So use the following code to replace the old version with the new one.

Ex: the following code replaces all instances of "5.0" with "7.5" in the PATH, as during writing this program, I had to update the CUDA verison from CUDA 5.0 to CUDA 7.5


set PATH=%PATH:5.0=7.5%
