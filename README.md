# GPU enhanced Neuronal Network (GeNN)

GeNN is a GPU enhanced Neuronal Network simulation environment based on
code generation for Nvidia CUDA.

For more details on how to use GeNN, please see the [documentation](http://genn-team.github.io/genn/documentation/html/index.html).

Original Authors: Yavuz, E., Turner, J. and Nowotny, T, CCNR University of Sussex.

I worked on GeNN during my internship during May-July 2016 at Centre for Computational Neuroscience and Robotics - CCNR, University of Sussex, United Kingdom under guidance of Prof. Thomas Nowotny and Dr Esin Yavuz.

I have implemented the AdEx model in GeNN and perofrmed some simulations of the honey bee mushroom body. Please see the attached report.
